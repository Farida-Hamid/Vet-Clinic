# Vet Clinic

> In the this project, I  use a relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic. Starting with one table, and step by step, create a complete database with data about:
- animals
- animals' owners
- clinic employees
- visits

Apart from building data structure, there are tasks that require SQL queries to answer specific questions.

## Built With
- PSQL
